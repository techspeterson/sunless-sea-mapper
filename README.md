# Sunless Sea Mapper
A tool for the game [Sunless Sea](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/), to aid in planning trade routes. Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Still very much a work in progress!

## How to use

Run `yarn start` to start the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Each tile on the map is either fixed (shown in grey), or randomly chosen from a given set of tiles (grouped by colour). Click on the name of a region to assign it to that tile and view the ports in that region.

## Planned features
- Quick visualisation of shop contents for each port
- Filter ports by item availability
- Port report tracker
- Make notes, mark ports as must-visit locations
- Persistent data
